Sanjay Soni's Revised Model: Continuous Emergence and Non-Cyclic Universe
Sanjay Soni – Dynamic Action-Reaction Model (Revised)
1. Objective
To provide a scientifically and philosophically grounded model that explains continuous emergence of new forms and processes in the universe, emphasizing that the universe is not cyclic and that each interaction generates new outcomes.
2. Core Concepts
Action and Reaction:
All physical, chemical, and biological processes operate via action-reaction principles.
Each action, in its unique combination, produces a specific reaction.
Emergent New Forms:
Every reaction produces a new form or structure.
Exact previous states do not recur.
Therefore, the universe cannot be strictly cyclic.
Physical, Chemical, and Biological Basis:
Core elements and physical laws are consistent across levels.
Differences in structure (physical, chemical, biological) emerge from the same underlying principles.
3. Patterns Across Levels
Level
Action Type
Reaction/Outcome
Feature
Physical
Matter-energy interaction
Structural transformation (water ↔ ice ↔ vapor)
Patterns may repeat; exact states do not
Chemical
Molecular interactions
New molecules and compounds
Stable rules, variable outcomes
Biological
Cellular and life processes
Growth, reproduction, novel structures
Same underlying process, different forms
Cosmological
Energy-combination interactions
Stars, planets, life, consciousness
Continuous evolution; non-cyclic
4. Key Revised Insight (New Discovery)
The universe is not cyclic.
Each interaction generates a new outcome; exact previous forms never recur.
Local patterns may repeat, but history itself does not repeat.
Continuous emergence of novelty is intrinsic to universal processes.
This constitutes the novel contribution and Sanjay Soni’s original discovery.
5. Scientific & Philosophical Significance
Explains why change and novelty are fundamental in physical, chemical, and biological systems.
Aligns with thermodynamics (entropy increase) and evolutionary theory.
Bridges natural philosophy and modern scientific reasoning.
Establishes a framework for international recognition and citation.
